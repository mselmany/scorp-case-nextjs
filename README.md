## Getting Started

Used tech stack;
- Next.js (server-side rendered react framework)
- Emotion (CSS-in-js)
- [easy-peasy](https://easy-peasy.vercel.app/) for state management
- Icons (my own)
- for tooling Next.js, uses webpack builtin
- no third-party dependency...

yarn && yarn dev
# or
npm i && npm run dev

# node -v: v12.21.0, yarn -v: 1.22.10
```
